THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN E-AGRICULTURAL MARKETING SYSTEM. The aim of this system is to connect farmers and buyers directly and to be a user friendly,secure and reliable system that can facilitate the marketing of agricultural product.
this repository has two branches the main branch which carries the farmers code and the master branch which carries the buyers code. i tried putting them in one branch but it will be confusing so i created two branches one for the farmer code and the other for the buyer code
